# How to create a Registered User
This guide will explain how to programmatically create a Registered User within Agent Handler. 

The key components of a Registered User are: 

- **Origin User ID**: Unique ID of the user of the agent.
- **Origin User Name**: The name of the user of the agent 
- **Shared Credentials Group:** The object that identifies the different groups a user is part of. 
    - **Origin Company ID**: The unique ID of the company of the user.
    - **Origin Company Name**: The name of the company of the user. 
    - **Custom Keys**:  This is an optional identifier / grouping container that you can provide for additional segmentation. 



### POST Request body from Agent Handler:

In your backend, set up a POST request to register the user to the below URL:

`https://ah-merge.dev/api/v1/registered-users
`

**You will provide these values in the request to Merge.**
```jsx
{
"origin_user_id": "customer_A_uuid_1234", // required UUID of user
"origin_user_name": "Yash Gogri", // human-readable user name
"shared_credential_group": {
	"origin_company_id": "Merge_uuid_12345", // optional UUID of the company the user is from 
	"origin_company_name": "Merge", // human-readable name of company
	"custom_groupings": {
		"custom_key_1": "Engineering", // an additional grouping under the Origin Company 
	}
}
}
```

### API Response from Agent Handler:

```jsx
{
"registered_user_id": "f9813dd5-e70b-484c-91d8-00acd6065b07"
}
```

This ID will be used as part of your MCP Entry URL for when the given Registered User begins to interact with your agent.
